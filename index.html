                    <ul>
                        <li>When I tried to connect to Brentwood's Wi-Fi, a pop-up message appeared asking me to log in. However, one of the buttons in the pop-up did not display any text, leaving me confused. I had to click on the button to discover that it was actually the "Sign in with Email" option. This lack of clear labeling created unnecessary confusion and hindered a smooth user experience.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>On Hinge, when I match with someone, their profile information is displayed in a section that requires horizontal scrolling to view more details. However, there is no clear indication or instruction that horizontal scrolling is needed. This could lead to new users not realizing they are missing additional information, resulting in a frustrating user experience.</li>

                <ul>
                    BCIT Mail is a crucial communication channel for all students. However, for new students, there is no clear indication on the <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/" target="_blank">BCIT homepage</a> directing them to access their BCIT Mail through the myBCIT portal. Additionally, the <a href="https://learn.bcit.ca/" target="_blank">Learning Hub</a> features a mail icon that is not connected to BCIT Mail, adding to the confusion.
